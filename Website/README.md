**Project Overview**

For this project, I was the one who typed the code onto the HTML itself. It was very clear that we faced some problems regarding the code itself.

Apparently, I underestimated the "pickiness" of HTML code, and the typos that I made were punished because the code just didn't run. Apparently, when you launch the HTML code itself via the file, it runs properly. However, when you try to see it on your web browser, it breaks down.

After fixing the typos, the next problem we faced was regarding the pictures themselves. I had put the images and other assets into an "assets" folder on GitHub, which caused the website to be unable to reference the image. The solution was the drag the assets into the primary folder itself.

I believe I contributed substantially to the group because I was tasked with the majority of the coding. It was really interesting to see how altering some parts of the HTML, whether that's the spacing or CSS file, can have a major impact on the website visuals.

My group members:
Antonio: Bio generation and co-programmer
Daniel: Image selection and helped a bit with programming as well
