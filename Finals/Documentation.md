### Final Project: Ren.Py Game

**My Project**

My final came through the inspiration of a visual novel game jam that I completed last November. My team and I created a Ren.Py game that involved a Winter Paradise that was very intuitive and easy to do. 

The first step was the learn Ren.Py. I went onto Youtube and watched a couple of tutorials and I was ready to go. 

The first problem I encountered was that I was unable to call upon my images. The dialogue was very simple to create and simply involved me declaring the character's name + their dialogue in quotations.However, I was unable to call upon my image despite following the instructions of the tutorials. 

Apparently, because I installed Ren.Py onto my external SSD, the file configuration was completely messed up. I had to relocate Ren.Py and it's asset files onto my main computer installation path, which it then worked. 

As I worked my way through, I got to the section where I needed to give the audience selections. This was done by creating a menu that involved jumping to certain choices. This was done by creating a **label** that would embody a certain bundle of code, very similar to a function that you can call upon. 

However, this was the biggest problem: I was somehow unable to call upon these labels at all. I would get a *syntax* error whenever I tried to jump to these certain choices. The issue here was with the strict formatting requirements of Ren.Py, where I had to replace spaces with underscores, put colons right after the menu choices, and add underscores to the jump commands.

My art assets were taken from Itch.io, specifically the Fantasy Forests pack and a variety of sprites. They were free to use and fit perfectly with my storyline: a group of friends trying to reach a Fantasy land of their dreams. I really liked how free we are able to explore in this final.
