### Final Proposal

**What will (likely) be the title of your project?**
World of Python 

**In just a sentence or two, summarize your project**
I'm creating a visual novel that tells the story of jungle explorers who stumbled onto the holy lands of the Pythons, where they are trapped within the temple and must solve puzzles to get out. However, the only communication they do is in binary digits...

**In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?**
I was thinking that my VN would have custom logic set to options that the player would be able to choose. For example, during the puzzles, the players would have four different variations to choose from. If they get it right, they get to progress. If not, death. Very dangerous.

RenPy would be the software I would program from. The game itself is meant to be entertaining while challenging, teaching the players to solve simple problems but in binary format. The features would be: custom artwork, custom logic, and some BG music. I will execute this via programming with Python.

**If you are planning to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's final project, with which other course?**
Not that I can think of.

**In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?**
Functioning game, with custom logic and two endings (death, escape). Artwork would be relatively clean and the story is well-developed. Minor bugs to the gameplay. Should also run without massive lag.

**In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?**
The bugs that are present should be very non-distracting. Artwork should be further developed to fit the mood. Character models and other elements on-screen should have different actions and animations available.

**In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?**
Secret ending? Artwork should be high-quality. No bugs, no lag. Should sustain roughly 8-10 minutes of gameplay. Music and SFX present.

**In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?**
Definitely going to need to learn RenPy, especially interface and controls. I will also need to research how to create the artwork itself, which will probably be through AI. I will also need to learn game logic and techniques, which I am also completely oblivious to.

**List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project**

Google itself I guess.
