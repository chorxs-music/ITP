### Think Python

**Chapter 5**

    One thing that I did not know was the "pass" command for if statements. It's interesting that we can simply write a conditional statement with "if", then write "pass" underneath it and we can leave the if statement as a reminder. I did know about the *else* statements that follow an if statement, but apparently, they are known as "branches". These alternatives allow so many possibilities for complex conditions instead of having to write *if statements* for every single condition.

**Chapter 7**

    One thing that I knew about was the updating variable feature. It seemed weird to me at first, but since the code runs from top to bottom, any new definition of a variable will override the previous one so that you won't need to create a separate variable to store the new value. However, i'm pretty sure there's a way to lock the value of a variable in place, i'm just not sure what it is on Python. I'm confused about the square root part. Why is it that the resulting number form Newton's square root formula keep changing? Although the values are miniscule, why shouldn't the answer stay consistent every time the code is ran? 

**Mice**

    This assignment was relatively straightforward in terms of what we were suppose to do...I thought. Printing three words right, how hard can it be?

    The first issue I ran into was that the word "Blind" and the word "Mice" were always on the same column. I created a code that looked something like this:

    print("3\n\tBlind\n\tMice")

    I didn't understand why and had to look this up on Google. Apparently, Python calculates the tab command from the start of the row, which meant that I had to "tab twice" in order to separate "Mice" from "Blind". Afterwards, I also realized that "3" needed to be a product of an equation, which I did "z = 1 + 2" and inputted "z" into the print function under {}. But then, I forgot to add the "f" statement before the quotation, which caused the "z" value to not be inserted. Everything was fine after that hurdle.
