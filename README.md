### Sections 4.4, 5.2

**4.4**

This section talks about the myriad of programming languages developed, although most have been retired. Different languages simply build upon lower level languages but express them in different ways. Three instances of languages were given:

1. Cobol, a language exclusively used by *banks*
2. Fortran, a language developed by *John Backus* that excels at numeric processes
3. Lisp, a language developed by *John McCarthy* that is more widely used than Fortran, especially by airlines


**5.2**

This section explains the basics of SQL, which stands for *Structure Query Language*. SQL is the language of databases, large storages of information that involve the heavy use of *IDs*. Huge companies such as Microsoft and Amazon use SQL to keep track of their transactions, similar to how a library would track each instance of books being checked out and checked back in.
